# Transmutation

Transmutation is a command-line tool written in Rust that allows you to use the power of language models to generate Rust code, and then seamlessly route that code to a specific file or directory while automatically formatting it to the Rust standard. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models, Transmutation can help you rapidly prototype, create, and maintain your Rust projects.

## Use Case

Transmutation is designed for developers who want to streamline their Rust development process. By utilizing language models, Transmutation can generate code snippets, functions, or even entire modules based on your input, saving you time and effort. This tool also automatically formats the generated code according to Rust standards, ensuring that your codebase remains clean and consistent.

## Planned Features

Integration with Language Models: Enhance Transmutation by directly integrating it with state-of-the-art language models like OpenAI's GPT-4. This will allow users to generate Rust code on-the-fly by providing input in natural language.

Code Generation Templates: Implement a set of predefined templates for common use cases, making it easier for developers to generate boilerplate code, such as struct definitions, trait implementations, and more.

Real-time Code Generation: Provide a real-time code generation mode, where developers can interactively provide input and receive code suggestions from the language model.

Support for Other Programming Languages: Extend the capabilities of Transmutation to support other programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Go, enabling a wider range of developers to take advantage of the tool.

Plugin System:
Develop a plugin system that allows users to extend Transmutation's functionality, such as integrating with popular IDEs, version control systems, and code review platforms.
